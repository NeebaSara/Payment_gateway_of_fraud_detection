# Payment_gateway_of_fraud_detection
Fraudulent activities in digital payment systems, especially through credit card and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions, have been growing concern in the financial sector. The proliferation of online transactions and digital wallets has made fraud detection more challenging. This paper presents a fraud detection system that uses machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data and identify suspicious behavior. The system can process data in real-time, monitor user behavior patterns and detect anomalies that are indicative of fraudulent activities. By integrating machine learning models, the system aims to increase accuracy, reduce false positives, and enhance the overall security of financial transactions.
